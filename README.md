<b>Ques 1: Write C++ program to create a doubly linkedlist and insert a node at any position . </b>
<br>
Input Linkedlist: 2<->4<->5 ,p = 2,<br>
x = 6 Output: 2 4 5 6, <br>
Explanation: p = 2, and x = 6. So, 6 is<br>
inserted after p, i.e, at position 3<br>
(0-based indexing).<br>
<br>
  <br>
<b>Ques 2: Write C++ program that detect the cycle inside a given linkedlist if their is any cycle present then print true otherwise print false.</b>
  Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1.<br>
  Output: true.<br>
  Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st nodeÂ (0-indexed).<br>
